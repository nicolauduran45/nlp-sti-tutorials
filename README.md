# NLP Tutorials for Analizing Research Projects & Publications

This repository contains interactive Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning methods to analyze research projects and publications.

The tutorials are based on work developed and make use of both proprietary classifiers and open-source models/tools. They aim to provide practical, hands-on examples of how text mining can be applied in research evaluation, policy analysis, and innovation studies.

## 📚 Tutorials

### 1. Analysing SHS Projects (`01_analysing_SHS_projects.ipynb`)
In this notebook we:
* **Classify** research projects to determine whether they are related to Social Sciences and Humanities (SHS) or not.
* **Classify disciplines** within SHS using NLP-based models.
* **Extract valorisation channels** described in the project texts (e.g., dissemination, societal impact, industrial applications).
